Computational properties of neural netwrok.

**spntaneous** collective sonsequence of having a large number of interacting simple consequence

delocalized contend-addressable memory or categorizer using extensive asynchronous parallel processing

# The general content-addressable memory of a physical system

**The general content-addressable memory of a physical system**

The definition of input: it's like how to define the internal states and the external states.

Physical system vs Hopfield network( Hebbian learning rule making it to be differenet)

# The model system

how to model the system

the meaning of s'

# The information storage algorithm
the desing of $ \sum _j V_j^{s'}(2 V_j ^s -1)$ can easily remove the noise from different patterns and maintain the average value of this equation to be $\frac {1}{2}$

# The biological interpretation of the model

Physics: the true collective effects in particle dynamics come from a nonlinear dependence of forces on positions of the particles.

Hopfield network: it comes from the nonlinear.

Feature extraction should have been done before the input.

# Study of the collective behaciors of the model

In the symmetric case, the outcome is expected because we knwo that the energy function that guarantees convergece.

In the asymmetric case, there is no guarantee fo convergence.


compare assymetric T is a finite temperature.

symetric T is a abosolute temperature.

### Why do we need clipped version?

Engineering motivation(Si-basedd contentt addressable memory)

 $T_{ij} \in [-3,3]$

 Recent memory +3 -> +1 -> +3

 [+1, +1, -1] (time window)
